<h2>About us:</h2></head>
<body><p>G.O.A (short for Goal-Oriented-Academy) is a programming academy where children of all age learn programming.<br>
<br>But there's much more than programming here. The CEO of G.O.A, Nika Keshelava is doing everything to bring his community together,
<br>By planning events such as, Hackathon and Goa-land.<br>
<h3>Hackathon</h3><br>
In Hackathon, groups of programming students compete with eachother for prizes and a good time. they compete in puzzles ,which the G.O.A mentors give.<br>
 Not only that, but students also compete in physical strength, for example:push ups, pull ups, armwrestling etc.
<br></p>

<h3>Goa-land</h3><br>
<p>Goa-land is an event available for any G.O.A. student and their families. you can bring your friends and loved ones to Goa-land to spend time together,<br>
on a nice field trip, for completely free.<br>
Here, you can do whatever you want, and with whoever you want. you can meet other G.O.A. students here and get to know each other better. <br>
did i mention physical competetions? just like hackathon, you can also compete here with others in: pull ups, push ups, arm wrestling, pulling the rope, and sports.<br>
if you want to brighten your future, by doing something productive and fun at the same time, join G.O.A., the only academy you'll ever need.</p><br>
