Github is a website where you can upload projects, works, and etc. for people,coworkers to see or some other reason.
git is a programm that lets you upload projects,files to github from the visual code terminal.
in git, you can create several versions of the same project.
git commands:

git init(when a project is recently created,to add version controll we need to use this command(this only happens once))

git add . (before you create a new version of the project, you have to select the files that you want to create a new version of, and then by using this command, you will create a new version of the project/file.)

git commit -m "second commit" (after git add. you have to use this commmand to create the version and name the version using the terminal (for example v0.1))

git push (using this command you can upload your work on github)
